## Instructions
In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.


## Repository_Contents
There is 1 coding deliverable called Crypto_Clustering.ipynb which contains all of the code in the challenge<br />
Inside of Resources is the data used in the code. 


## Questions
All Questions are answered inside of the jupyter notebook file<br />
Below you will find a sample view of the resulting graphs. First the Elbow curves. <br />

## Givens
Most of my process was very straight forward. I completed all of the working testing along the way.<br />
All code was generated by myself or by EDX.<br />
Dataset created by the United States Geological Survey. <br />
Data for this dataset and instructions were generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
